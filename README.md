I suffered acute slip disk in Jan 2026(good start of the year), which lead me to ER and then 5 days in hospital.
I had to go through SNRB(Severe Nerve Root Block) proceure which made me in less pain and gave me cushion time to recover through physiotherapy.

You can read more about [SNRB]("https://www.upmc.com/services/neurosurgery/spine/treatment/pain-management/nerve-root-injection")


During my physiotherapy, I had to keep track of how much am I able to SIT, WALK, LAY Down and STAND.
That is when I created this small app to help me keep track and share the same with my Physio.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
